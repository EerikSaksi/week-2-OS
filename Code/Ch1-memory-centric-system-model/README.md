# Processor models in Python

This folder contains the code used in Chapter 1 of the book "Operating Systems Foundations - With Linux on the Raspberry Pi". 
The main function is in the file `abstract_system_model.py`, so you can run the model by doing

    $ python3 ./abstract_system_model.py

The folder `cpp-code` contains a C++ version of the Python code, FYI.
